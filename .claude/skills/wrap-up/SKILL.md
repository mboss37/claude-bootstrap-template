# Session Wrap-Up

Update `TASKS.md` following these strict rules:

1. Move completed tasks to "Done" section
2. Move any in-progress work to "In Progress" with a short note
3. Append session log entry (max 3 lines: what done, decisions, what's next)
4. **Keep only the last 3 session log entries** — delete older ones
5. When a sprint is fully complete, collapse it to one line under "Completed Sprints" and promote the next sprint to "Current"
6. Only show Current + Next sprint tasks — never list all 6 sprints
7. **Target: keep TASKS.md under 80 lines total**
8. Show the user a brief summary of what was accomplished
