# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Task Tracker

> Claude: Read this at session start. Keep this file SHORT — only current state matters.
> Rules: (1) Only show current + next sprint tasks. (2) Completed sprints get one summary line. (3) Session log: max 3 lines per session, keep only last 3 sessions. (4) Target: under 80 lines total.
